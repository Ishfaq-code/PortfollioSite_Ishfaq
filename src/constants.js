        description: "Crimson Brawl is a game developed in Godot during Knight Hacks VIII that won the 'Best Game Hack' award. It is a fighting game where one player is controlled using EEG input, while the other uses standard keyboard controls. We trained a machine learning model on various brainwave patterns to interpret EEG signals and translate them into player inputs.",
